# ✅ Fixed: Cannot read properties of undefined

## 🐛 Problem:
Error: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'tenant')` in CategorySidebar

This happened because the API response structure was nested, and the code was trying to access properties incorrectly.

---

## ✅ Solution:

### **Fixed API Response Handling**:

The API returns:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "venue": {
      "id": "...",
      "name": "Main Branch",
      "tenant": {
        "name": "Tuesday Coffee"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

But the code was trying to access `venueInfo?.venue.tenant.name` when `venueInfo` IS the venue object.

### **Changed**:

**Before (wrong):**
```typescript
{venueInfo?.venue.tenant.name || "Welcome"}
{venueInfo?.venue.name || "Digital Menu"}
```

**After (correct):**
```typescript
{venueInfo?.tenant.name || "Welcome"}
{venueInfo?.name || "Digital Menu"}
```

### **Also Fixed venueApi.ts**:
```typescript
// Now correctly handles the nested response structure
const response = await api.get<{ success: boolean; data: { venue: VenueInfo } }>(`/api/v1/venues/${venueId}/info`);
return response.data.venue; // Returns the VenueInfo object
```

## ✅ Status:

- ✅ venueApi correctly extracts venue from response
- ✅ CategorySidebar correctly accesses venue properties
- ✅ Tenant name: "Tuesday Coffee"
- ✅ Venue name: "Main Branch"
- ✅ No more undefined errors

The customer app now correctly displays real tenant and venue names! 🎉
