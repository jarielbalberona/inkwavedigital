# Venue Management Implementation - Complete!

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Backend API Endpoints**

Created new use cases for venue management:
- `GetVenuesUseCase` - Get all venues for a tenant
- `CreateVenueUseCase` - Create a new venue
- `UpdateVenueUseCase` - Update venue details
- `DeleteVenueUseCase` - Delete a venue

Updated `VenueController` with new methods:
- `getVenues()` - GET `/api/v1/venues`
- `createVenue()` - POST `/api/v1/venues`
- `updateVenue()` - PUT `/api/v1/venues/:venueId`
- `deleteVenue()` - DELETE `/api/v1/venues/:venueId`

### 2. **Authentication & Tenant ID**

Added `getTenantId` endpoint to `AuthController`:
- GET `/api/v1/auth/tenant-id` - Get tenant ID from user email

Created `useTenantId` hook in dashboard to fetch user's tenant ID

### 3. **Venue Management UI**

Created `VenueManagementPage` with:
- List all venues for the current tenant
- Create new venues
- Edit existing venues
- Delete venues
- Form validation and error handling

Created `VenueSelector` component:
- Dropdown to select active venue
- Auto-selects first venue if none selected
- Shows "No venues available" if empty

### 4. **Updated Dashboard Navigation**

Modified `App.tsx` to:
- Show "Venues" page by default for tenant owners
- Add venue selector dropdown in navigation
- Require venue selection before accessing KDS, Menu, or QR features
- Auto-select first venue when venues are available

### 5. **Venue-Specific Features**

All features now work with selected venue:
- **KDS** - View and manage orders for selected venue
- **Menu Management** - Manage menu items for selected venue
- **QR Management** - Generate and manage QR codes for selected venue

## 🎯 User Flow

### Tenant Owner Experience

1. **Login** as tenant owner
2. **Landing Page**: See "Venues" page by default
3. **Create Venue**: Click "Add Venue" → Fill form → Create
4. **Select Venue**: Use dropdown in navigation to select venue
5. **Access Features**: 
   - Click "KDS" to view venue orders
   - Click "Menu" to manage venue menu
   - Click "QR Codes" to generate venue QR codes

### Super Admin Experience

Super admins continue to see only "Tenant Management" and can create tenants (which may create an initial venue).

## 🔄 How It Works

### Database Structure:
```
Tenants → Venues → Menus → Categories → Items
              ↓
          Orders
              ↓
          Tables (QR Codes)
```

### API Request Flow:
1. User logs in with Clerk
2. Dashboard fetches user's email
3. API looks up user by email → gets tenantId
4. API endpoints require `x-tenant-id` header
5. All venue operations are filtered by tenantId

### Frontend State Management:
1. `useTenantId()` - Gets tenant ID from user email
2. `selectedVenueId` - State in App.tsx for active venue
3. `VenueSelector` - Updates selected venue
4. All pages receive `venueId` as prop

---

## 🧪 Testing

1. Start the application:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

2. Login as tenant owner (not super admin)

3. Verify venue management:
   - Should see "Venues" page by default
   - Create a new venue with name, slug, address, timezone
   - Edit the venue details
   - Create another venue to test selection

4. Test venue-specific features:
   - Select a venue from dropdown
   - Access KDS, Menu, QR features
   - Verify data is scoped to selected venue

---

## 🎉 Summary

The venue management system is now fully implemented! Tenant owners must:
1. Create at least one venue
2. Select the venue they want to work with
3. All KDS, Menu, and QR operations are then scoped to that venue

This ensures proper data isolation between different venues/branches within the same tenant.
