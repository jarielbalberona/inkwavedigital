## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. **Super Admin Creates Tenant**
```
Super Admin → Dashboard → "Add Tenant"
  → Enters: Name, Slug, Owner Email
  → Submits form
  → API receives request
```

### 2. **API Processes Request**
```
API receives CreateTenant request:
  1. Creates tenant in database
  2. Sends Clerk invitation to owner email
  3. Creates user record with:
     - email: owner email
     - role: "owner"
     - tenantId: new tenant ID
     - clerkUserId: null (will be set when they sign in)
  4. Creates venue if optional venue was specified
```

### 3. **Owner Receives Email**
```
Clerk sends invitation email to owner:
  → Owner clicks link
  → Goes to Clerk sign-up page
  → Completes sign-up
  → Gets Clerk user ID
```

### 4. **Owner Signs In First Time**
```
When owner first signs in:
  → API detects new user (via webhook or manual update)
  → Updates user record with clerk_user_id
  → Owner can now manage their tenant
```

```

## 🔍 Manual Verification

### Check User Created in Database
```sql
SELECT id, email, role, tenant_id, clerk_user_id 
FROM users 
WHERE role = 'owner';
```

### Check Tenant Created
```sql
SELECT id, name, slug 
FROM tenants;
```

### Check Clerk Dashboard
- Go to Clerk Dashboard → Users
- Should see new user with the email
- Status should show "Invited" or "Active"

## 🚀 Next Steps for Owner

Once owner signs in:

1. **They need their own dashboard view**
   - Different from super admin view
   - See only their tenant's venues
   - Manage venues, staff, etc.

2. **Implement Tenant Owner Dashboard**
   - Add role check in dashboard
   - Show different navigation for tenant owners
   - Filter data by tenant_id

3. **Add Staff Invitation**
   - Tenant owner invites staff
   - Staff assigned to specific venues
   - Staff roles and permissions

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Invitation Not Sent
- Check `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` in `.env`
- Check API logs for errors
- Verify email format

### User Record Not Created
- Check database connection
- Verify user table exists
- Check API logs

### Owner Can't Sign In
- Invitation may have expired
- Resend invitation via Clerk dashboard
- Check email spam folder
