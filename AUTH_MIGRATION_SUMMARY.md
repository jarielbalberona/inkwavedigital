# Authentication Migration Summary

## What Was Done

Migrated from **mock authentication** to **real Clerk authentication** for both development and production environments.

## Files Modified

### Backend
- ✅ `apps/api/src/infrastructure/middlewares/auth.middleware.ts`
  - Implemented JWT token verification with Clerk
  - Extract user ID and email from Clerk
  - Extract tenant ID from Clerk's `publicMetadata`

### Frontend
- ✅ `apps/dashboard/src/lib/api.ts`
  - Added Axios request interceptor
  - Automatically includes Clerk session token in all API requests
  - Handles authentication transparently

### Documentation
- ✅ `CLERK_AUTH_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Complete authentication guide
- ✅ `AUTH_MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## Why This Change?

**Your Question**: "why we are using mock auth in development? dont we have access to clerks data in local dev?"

**Answer**: You're absolutely right! Clerk provides the same authentication in development as in production. The mock auth was a placeholder that should have been replaced. Now the app uses real Clerk authentication everywhere.

## Benefits

1. **Consistent**: Same auth flow in dev and production
2. **Secure**: Real JWT verification, not hardcoded values
3. **Multi-tenant**: Each user has their own `tenantId` from Clerk metadata
4. **Automatic**: Token refresh handled by Clerk
5. **Maintainable**: No need to update mock user IDs

## How It Works Now

### Before (Mock)
```typescript
// Hardcoded mock data
req.auth = {
  userId: "dab16db9-8805-4027-be8b-e0cf2e444422",
  email: "hello@inkwavebrand.ing"
};
req.tenantId = "a1088200-e822-4a1d-b796-ff6abf742155";
```

### After (Real Clerk)
```typescript
// Real authentication
const token = req.headers.authorization; // From frontend
const session = await clerkClient.sessions.verifySession(token);
const user = await clerkClient.users.getUser(session.userId);

req.auth = {
  userId: session.userId,  // Real Clerk user ID
  email: user.emailAddresses[0]?.emailAddress
};
req.tenantId = user.publicMetadata?.tenantId; // From Clerk metadata
```

## Required Setup

### 1. Get Clerk API Keys

Visit https://clerk.com and get:
- `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` (for API)
- `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (for Dashboard)

### 2. Add to .env Files

**Root .env** (for Docker):
```bash
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
```

### 3. Set User Metadata

Each user needs a `tenantId` in their Clerk metadata:

```typescript
// Via Clerk Dashboard or API
await clerkClient.users.updateUser(userId, {
  publicMetadata: {
    tenantId: "a1088200-e822-4a1d-b796-ff6abf742155"
  }
});
```

## Testing

### 1. Restart Services

```bash
docker-compose restart api
cd apps/dashboard && pnpm dev
```

### 2. Sign In

- Navigate to http://localhost:5173
- Sign in with Clerk
- Check browser console for token

### 3. Test API Calls

- Try uploading an image
- Check API logs: `docker-compose logs api -f`
- Should see: "User authenticated successfully"

## Current Status

- ✅ Backend authentication implemented
- ✅ Frontend token injection implemented
- ✅ Documentation created
- ⚠️ Requires Clerk API keys to be configured
- ⚠️ Requires user metadata (`tenantId`) to be set in Clerk

## Next Steps

1. **Configure Clerk**: Add API keys to `.env` files
2. **Set Metadata**: Add `tenantId` to user's `publicMetadata` in Clerk
3. **Test**: Sign in and verify image uploads work
4. **Production**: Same setup works in production with production Clerk keys

## Notes

- **Customer App**: Does NOT require authentication (anonymous QR code scanning)
- **Development**: Uses same Clerk auth as production
- **Security**: JWT tokens are verified on every request
- **Multi-tenant**: Tenant isolation via Clerk metadata
