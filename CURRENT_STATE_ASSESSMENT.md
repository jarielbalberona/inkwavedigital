## ⚠️ Known Issues / Incomplete Features

### 1. **Order Status Updates** 🟡
**Issue**: Order status update functionality exists in the backend but not fully connected in the frontend.

**What exists:**
- API endpoint: `PUT /api/v1/orders/:orderId/status`
- `UpdateOrderStatusUseCase` in backend
- `useUpdateOrderStatus` hook in dashboard

**What's missing:**
- UI buttons/controls in `KDSPage` or `OrderStatusColumn` to actually trigger status updates
- Visual feedback when status changes
- WebSocket integration for real-time updates (commented out in code)

**Priority**: High (this is critical for a KDS system)

---

### 2. **WebSocket Integration** 🔴
**Issue**: WebSocket for real-time order updates is implemented but disabled.

**Current state:**
- WebSocket infrastructure exists in `apps/api/src/infrastructure/websocket/`
- Code is commented out in `CreateOrderUseCase.ts`
- No client-side WebSocket connection in dashboard

**What's needed:**
- Enable WebSocket broadcasts on order creation
- Add WebSocket client connection in dashboard
- Real-time order notifications in KDS

**Priority**: Medium (MVP can work with polling, but real-time is better)

---

### 3. **Staff Management** 🟡
**Issue**: Staff invitation and management functionality not implemented.

**What exists:**
- Database schema for users with roles
- `venue_staff` table exists for manager/staff assignments
- `getUserRole` API endpoint that can return staff roles
- Role-based filtering in venue selector

**What's missing:**
- UI for owners to invite staff/managers
- Clerk invitation integration for staff
- Staff assignment to specific venues
- Permission system (who can do what)

**Priority**: Medium (can be done after core flow works)

---

### 4. **File Uploads** 🟡
**Issue**: Image upload for menu items not fully implemented.

**What exists:**
- Database fields for `imageUrl` in menu items
- Cloudflare R2 mentioned in architecture

**What's missing:**
- Actual image upload functionality
- File storage service integration
- Image URL generation

**Priority**: Low (can use placeholder images for MVP)

---

### 5. **Customer Authentication** 🟡
**Issue**: Customer app is anonymous, no sign-in option.

**What exists:**
- Anonymous customer experience works
- Cart and session management with device IDs

**What's missing:**
- Customer account creation
- Sign-in flow
- Order history for customers
- Points/loyalty system (mentioned in plans)

**Priority**: Low (MVP can work with anonymous customers)

---

## 🎯 Recommended Priority Order

### **Priority 1: Fix Order Status Updates** (HIGH - Blocks KDS functionality)
**Why**: This is the core feature of a kitchen display system. Orders are created but can't be managed.

**Tasks:**
1. Add status update buttons to `OrderStatusColumn` component
2. Connect buttons to `useUpdateOrderStatus` hook
3. Test status transitions (NEW → PREPARING → READY → SERVED)
4. Add visual feedback (loading states, success messages)

**Estimated effort**: 2-4 hours

---

### **Priority 2: Enable WebSocket for Real-Time Updates** (MEDIUM - Improves UX)
**Why**: Makes the KDS feel responsive and professional.

**Tasks:**
1. Uncomment WebSocket code in `CreateOrderUseCase`
2. Add WebSocket client to dashboard KDS page
3. Handle incoming order events
4. Update UI in real-time when new orders arrive or status changes

**Estimated effort**: 4-6 hours

---

### **Priority 3: Complete Staff Management** (MEDIUM - Enables multi-user workflows)
**Why**: Allows restaurants to have staff who can only access specific venues.

**Tasks:**
1. Create staff invitation UI in dashboard
2. Connect to Clerk invitation API
3. Implement staff assignment to venues
4. Add permission checks (owners can do anything, staff limited)

**Estimated effort**: 8-12 hours

---

### **Priority 4: Image Upload** (LOW - Nice to have)
**Why**: Makes the menu look professional.

**Tasks:**
1. Set up Cloudflare R2 bucket
2. Create file upload API endpoint
3. Connect to menu item forms
4. Display uploaded images in customer app

**Estimated effort**: 6-8 hours

---

### **Priority 5: Customer Sign-In** (LOW - Future feature)
**Why**: Enables order history and loyalty features.

**Tasks:**
1. Add Clerk sign-in to customer app
2. Merge anonymous cart with user account
3. Store order history
4. Implement points system

**Estimated effort**: 12-16 hours

5. ⏳ Clerk authentication in production mode
6. ❌ Error handling and logging
7. ❌ API rate limiting
8. ❌ Input validation improvements

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps (This Week)

### 1. **Fix Order Status Updates** (2-4 hours)
```typescript
// Add to OrderStatusColumn.tsx
<button onClick={() => updateStatus(order.id, 'NEXT_STATUS')}>
  Mark as {nextStatus}

```

### 2. **Test End-to-End Flow** (1-2 hours)
1. Create order in customer app
2. Verify it appears in KDS
3. Update order status in KDS
4. Verify status changes
5. Complete full order lifecycle

### 3. **Clean Up Test Data** (1 hour)
- Remove any remaining test data
- Ensure production IDs are used everywhere
- Document the one tenant/venue in production

### 4. **Enable WebSocket** (4-6 hours)
- Uncomment code in CreateOrderUseCase
